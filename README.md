##IC Hack 17 Project: Zombie Hack

Marek Beseda, George Kousouris, Tanmay Khanna, and Ashley Davies' IC Hack 17 submission.

Made in Unity with C#, this game features 8 varities of Zombie in a top-down classic zombie shooting mechanic, with the added twist of tower building!

Make a base and see how many waves of zombies you can outlast - but be careful, because the explosive zombies have tricks up their sleeve - they'll target any buildings you surround yourself with, and if they succeed, you might just end up with a swarm of explosive zombies charging you.

This must be opened in Unity 5.5.0 - newer versions may cause lighting issues.
